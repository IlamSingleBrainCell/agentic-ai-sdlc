    "security_review_feedback": "The provided code snippet demonstrates a basic application structure with functionalities for managing organizations and user dashboards. However, several security considerations need to be addressed.  \n\n**Admin Service:**\n\n*   The `create_organization` function lacks input validation. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing malformed or malicious input, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities or unauthorized data modification.  \n*   The function also doesn't specify any authorization mechanisms. This means that any user could potentially call `create_organization`, bypassing access controls and creating organizations without proper authorization. \n\n**User Dashboard:**\n\n*   The `export_data` function should implement proper input validation for the `format` parameter.  A malicious user could potentially provide an unexpected format, leading to unexpected behavior or code execution vulnerabilities.  \n*   The function also lacks output sanitization.  If the exported data contains user-sensitive information, it should be sanitized before being returned to the user.  \n\n**API:**\n\n*   The API endpoints lack proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.  An attacker could potentially make unauthorized requests and access sensitive information or functionalities. \n*   Error handling is not present in the API endpoints.  This could expose sensitive information or system details to attackers. ",
