[Test Case Name]: DataLineage - Track data transformations

[Test Type]: Positive

[Test Steps]:
1. Create two `DataTransformation` objects, each representing a different transformation step.
2. Append these transformations to the `lineage_record`.
3. Simulate data flowing through these transformations.
4. Verify that the `lineage_record` accurately reflects the sequence of transformations applied to the data.
